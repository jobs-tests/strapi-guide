# Email Instruction

It's a technical assessment, an exercise on a topic ü•Å that concerns the position.

You will have 7 days to work on it if you chose to continue the process

Everything is explained in the markdown files that are in the ZIP file. 

These 2 tests (frontend and backend) are independent. 

This assessment is not only/just about coding and technical knowledge.
